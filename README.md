# LLM Finetuning

---

* In this Project I will explore LLMs finetuning with **LoRA** and **QLoRA** with adoption of **MLOps** using **MLFlow** , I will not use Python notebooks to avoid being far away from production environment.


## TODO

- [X] getting a working finetuning pipeline
- [X] using LoRA and QLoRA
- [ ] using mlflow
  - [ ] using normal tracking techniques
  - [ ] using inference and testing in mlflow
  - [ ] using mlflow serve
- [ ] trying different finetuning techniques
- [ ] preparing the project to be a template for different finetuning projects
